### Disclaimer

I have absolutely no intention to monetize, make profits or appropriate
this millenial cultural heritage in any way. This project is a labor of
love to help spread the joy of Sumo wrestling across the world by making
it easy for AI to reason and answer questions about Sumo with historical
and live data.

From the bottom of my heart, I apologize in advance to any Japanese person
who might feel that I am engaging in cultural appropriation. I am truly sorry.

「もし私の活動が文化の盗用と感じられてしまう方がいらっしゃいましたら、心よりお詫び申し上げます。本当にごめんなさい。」
